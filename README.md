# ***Glass Type Identification***
This project aims to develop a glass type identification system using machine learning techniques. Accurate identification of glass types can be highly useful in criminal investigations, providing solid evidence at crime scenes. Also could be really interesting for glass producers just to be able to reduce the production costs and and increase efficiency.

# Problem Description
Identifying glass types is important in determining the origin and potential use of glass evidence in criminal investigations. By analyzing the composition of glass samples, we can classify them into different types based on their chemical properties and manufacturing processes.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 214 glass samples. Each sample can be categorized into one of six types, including building windows float processed, building windows non-float processed, vehicle windows float processed, vehicle windows non-float processed, containers, and tableware.

# Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:

Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify glass samples into their respective types.
Evaluate the performance of different classification algorithms and select the most effective one.
Provide a user-friendly interface to input glass samples and obtain their predicted types.
Enhance the understanding and application of machine learning techniques in forensic investigations.

# Dataset
The glass type dataset consists of 214 samples, with each sample represented by various features such as refractive index, sodium content, magnesium content, and others. The dataset has been preprocessed and is ready for use in training and evaluating machine learning models.
